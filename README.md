# Explainable GenAI Insight Platform (v1)

##  Problem Statement

Modern enterprises receive large volumes of unstructured text data such as customer feedback, reviews, internal reports, and support tickets. Extracting actionable insights from this data is difficult due to its unstructured nature and the limitations of traditional keyword-based analysis.

This project aims to design and build a **v1 Explainable GenAI Insight Platform** that processes raw text input and generates structured, explainable insights using modern NLP and Large Language Models.

The system demonstrates an end-to-end GenAI pipeline including preprocessing, semantic embedding, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), explainability, and API-based delivery.

##  Why this matters

- Demonstrates complete GenAI system thinking  
- Shows understanding beyond just calling an LLM API  
- Focuses on explainability and architecture  
- Designed as a learning-focused v1 system
